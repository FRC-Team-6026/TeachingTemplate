This code is developed by FRC Team 6026 deriving from FRC year 2023 - ChargedUp's code.
Special thanks must go to FRC Team 3512 of whose code was the base of our team's 2023 code, and a majority of the in-depth logic for the swerve drive and we would not have been able to properly function during the build season without it due to some outside limitations on our time getting used to the swerve drive format.

This repository utilizes the use of SparkMax Controllers, Neo Motors, and a Navx2 Gyro for the creation of said repository.

As well, this repository also utilizes the ratios for the MK4i modules from Swerve Drive Specialties of the L2 variation, although double checking these ratios as to if they are still true would be advised.

The control system assumption with this current revision of the program controls is with a xbox controller, or at minimum a controller recognized by the drive station as xbox.

SmartDashboard is used for data feedback to the user-client of the robot.

Lastly, this repository's subsystems will be partially modified around the possibility that the 2024 WPILib release removes period calls for subsystems themselves and instead will outsource as much reporting and data updates as possible based on that assumption/possibility to minimize potential issues down the road.
